## Experiences

`2016 - now`
__Data Scientist__ *Lincoln, Ile-de-France*  

Data Science consultant 
* Proeficient in R and Python and basic knowledge in SAS
* Regular use of different machin learning methods/algorithms (PLS regression, Lasso/Ridge regression, ACP, Fourier Series)
* Shiny development (dashboard, applications) alongside with HTML/CSS and JavaScript
* R trainer for lincoln client

__Servier__ `2019 - now`  
Part of the Data-Science team in the CENTEX MVD, I am in charge of different type of projects going from scientific publications analysis to drug repurposing/target discovery.  

* The projects about scientific publications analysis are about the identification of relevant documents about some specific inputs (for exemple, extract all publications about a specific biomarker and prognosis in a certain disease/condition). To achieve this we set up a pipeline using Spacy and regex base rules that allow us to make shorlists of publications about a given subject. All the publications were collected from NCBI PubMed/NCBI PMC.
* The drug repuposing project is about setting up a novel drug repurposing and target discovery platform. This project split up in different parts:
    - The identification and the gathering of relevant open source databases on wich we build our pipelines (in addition of internal databases). 
    - The implementation of all the analytic part that mainly rely on tools and well knwon algorithms from graph theory. 
    - The creation of an application in order to expose data and analytic results.

I also had the opportunity to work briefly on image recognition projects that use deep learning algorithms.

Technologies : Python, R, R Shiny, MongoDB, Neo4j, Node.js/Vue.js, Cytoscape, Tensorflow, Spacy
    
__Carrefour__ `2017 - 2019`  

While working for CSA Data Consulting, I had the opportunity to work at Carrefour's french headquarter in Massy. The objective was to deliver to Carrefour a tool to analyze the performance of past media-marketing campaign and provide insight on how to drive their future media investments. 

__CSA Data Consulting__ `2016 - 2019`  
Implementation of marketing mix modelling analysis in order to evaluate the impact of different factors (media investments, CRM, discounts ...) on business indicator. 
Providing insight and advice base on the results of our analysis to drive the future media marketing campaign for CSA DC's clients (B2B).

* Data cleaning/wrangling
* Building structured databases
* Marketing Mix Modelling implementation using well known algorithm (OLS/PLS regression, Elasticnet)
* Building data visualisation/simulation application containing:
    - Basic statistics on past media investments
    - MMM results
    - Insights/Advices and simulation tool for future media marketing campaigns

Technologies : SAS, R, R Shiny, HTML/CSS, JavaScript  
Methods : OLS/PLS regression, fourrier series

`2016`
__Geomarketing and Statistic Intership__ *SoLocal Group - Pages Jaunes, Ile-de-France*  
I was working for the datamining team of a marketing department. The objective of my internship was to developp a tool to detect sales opportunities on SEA/search product for the PagesJaunes search engine.  
The opportunities were identified by taking into account, for a given professional, all the competitors in his geographic area/business, the actual volume of search queries made by potential clients and the search product currently sold to competitors.
After an atemp to build a tool using excel/VBA and SAS, I finally choose to build a shiny application. The application allow the sales force to search for a given professionals (either client or prospect) to get all the search product for which he might have an interest in order to improve his visibility.

Technologies : R, SAS, QGIS, JavaScript, Leaflet.js, Visual Basic, Excel

## Side projects

__Lincoln's Data Science challenges__  
Internal data science challenge organize by Lincoln on various subjects from data visualisation to deep learning. Those challenges are an opportunity to improve and developp new programming skills and to learn novel machin learning methods/algorithms (deep learning, NLP, ...).

__Twitter and the 2024 Olympics games__  
In this project, we were working on a set of tweets about the olympics games of 2024. I try to identify major events that occure during the period that cover the Paris application by clustering weeks base on the words used in the tweets. I also create a web app that rely on elastic search to visualize my results.

Technologies : Python, HTML/CSS, ElasticSearch  
Methods : Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, T-SNE, DBSCAN  

__Dataviz - Cleanliness in Paris__  
Creation of a dashboard on the topic of street cleanliness in Paris using Open Data.

Technologies : HTML/CSS, Highcharts.hs, Leaflet.js  

__Image recognition with CIFAR-10__ 
Deep learning project on CIFAR-10 dataset. For this project, I implement a convutionnal neural network framework from scratch in python/numpy.  
I also created a webapp using Django in order to test my implementation after a training on MNIST. Users can draw a figure in the app and get the app tell the user wich figure he has drawn using my neural network implementation.

__Reinforcment Learning__  
Using Deep Q neural network in order to train an agent to play Atari 2600 Games (Space Invaders for now on)
Technologies : Python, Keras, OpenAI Gym  
Methods : Autoencoder, CNN, DQN  

__Budget managment application__
Creation of a web application in Vue.js to monitor my expenses.
All the datas are scraped from my bank website and stored in a MySQL databases with a python backend to bond between the database and the Vue.js application.

Technologies : Vue.js, MySQL, Selenium
